### üòû The Problem 
The fundamental issue in the United States is that people's food has been turned into a weapon. As a result, without all the information, people can no longer make an informed choice. The processed and ultra-processed foods we eat today can cause ADHD, thyroid tumors, stomach cancer, UC, Crohn's disease, breast cancer, bladder cancer, etc. These claims are supported by data from numerous health organizations, which is shown below.

Consider this: the rise in the previously listed underlying diseases is caused by processed foods. What about making an effort to alter people's eating habits? Understand what they ingest by reading the contents listed on these items, and in particular, make a distinction between the ingredients and any additives that may not be listed as such.

These additives contain dangerous substances that can and will change how the body functions and cause permanent harm to it.

### üòä Our Solution
iQFood will discuss the distinction between elements that go into making food items and additives that should never be used in food products and the potential harm they may do to the body.

The application addresses this problem by providing resources such as YouTube videos and articles that explain the health risks of processed foods. Additionally, it offers alternative food options or meals specifically designed for individuals that can not afford whole foods or have underlying illness like IBD, IBS, etc. It also allows you to see what foods will cause these problems to get worse. With that information, users will be able to like and comment on other user‚Äôs grocery lists that will contain their daily nutrients that they consume.
 Product will be using an API that would retrieve information of food products
- nutrient score
- nutritional facts
- nova scoring [minimally processed foods]
- adding additional labels, certification, and awards 
In short:
Users will make a grocery list and add items to it and when they click on the item it will call an API, which will return all the information listed above.
